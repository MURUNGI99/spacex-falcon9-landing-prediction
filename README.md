SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

Project Overview
This repository contains the capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, focused on predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landings. Conducted for Space Y, a fictional competitor to SpaceX, the project leverages public launch data to enable cost estimation and competitive bidding. By analyzing factors like payload mass, orbit type, and launch site proximity, we achieve ~85% prediction accuracy using exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL, Python visualizations, geospatial mapping, and machine learning. The goal is to support Space Y in reducing launch costs (e.g., $62M vs. competitorsâ€™ $165M+) through reusability insights.

Objectives
Predict Landing Success: Develop a machine learning model to forecast Falcon 9 first-stage landing outcome
Cost Estimation: Enable Space Y to estimate launch costs based on reusability predictions.
Geospatial Analysis: Map launch sites and proximities (e.g., coastlines, railways) to uncover location-based patterns.
Interactive Visualization: Create dashboards to explore data dynamically for stakeholders.

Methodology
Data Source: Public SpaceX dataset from IBM Cloud (dataset_part_2.csv).
